**Logistic Regression **
In the file Logistic_Regg_SVM_Decision_Tree , Logistic Regression mode is made from scratch and Iris data is used to check the functionality
and the scalibility of the model , additionally the decison boundary is vizualized in otder to check the decison bounday 
of the algorithm. On checking the preformance of the model the following stats were generated.

Logistic Regression Evaluation

Accuracy: 0.9333333333333333
Precision: 0.9565217391304348
Recall: 0.8888888888888888
F1 Score: 0.9147727272727273

**Support Vector Machine **
In the file Logistic_Regg_SVM_Decision_Tree , the implimentation of Support Vector Machine is done , also known as SVM , here the model was built and 
trained, which is also scalable to another datasets as well, in this case, the iris dataset was used to check the functionality of
the algorithm. In addition the model's decison boundary was vizualized.On evaluating the model, we have received the following stats.

**Decision Tree**
In the File Logistic_Regg_SVM_Decision_Tree  , the Decison Tree is made from the scratch , actually it contains two implementation of the Decision Tree algorithm ,
the first one is ID3 algorithm  and the second is C 4.5 algorithm which is enhanced implimentation of ID3 , to overcome all the issues. 
In both the cases , to evaluating the model we have used the iris dataset. The stats we recived are as follows:

Decision Tree ID3 Evaluation
